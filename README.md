# PCA-Manual-Implementation

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. Here are the steps to implement PCA:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Ensure that your data is numeric and standardized (mean-centered and scaled to unit variance) since PCA is sensitive to the scale of the variables.

2. **Compute the Covariance Matrix:**
   - Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix is a square matrix that represents the relationships between all pairs of variables.

   \[ \text{Covariance matrix} (C) = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^T \cdot (X_i - \bar{X}) \]

   where \(X_i\) is the standardized data vector and \(\bar{X}\) is the mean vector.

3. **Compute Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues:**
   - Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance, and eigenvalues represent the magnitude of the variance in those directions.

   \[ \text{C} \cdot \text{v} = \lambda \cdot \text{v} \]

   where \(\text{v}\) is the eigenvector and \(\lambda\) is the corresponding eigenvalue.

4. **Sort Eigenvalues:**
   - Sort the eigenvalues in descending order. The corresponding eigenvectors should be reordered accordingly.

5. **Choose Principal Components:**
   - Select the top \(k\) eigenvectors based on the desired number of principal components (\(k\)) or the variance you want to retain.

6. **Create Projection Matrix:**
   - Form a projection matrix (\(P\)) by stacking the selected eigenvectors as columns.

   \[ P = [v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k] \]

7. **Project Data onto Lower-Dimensional Space:**
   - Project the original data (\(X\)) onto the lower-dimensional space using the projection matrix:

   \[ \text{PCA} = X \cdot P \]

   The resulting matrix \(\text{PCA}\) contains the principal components of the data.
