# PCA-Manual-Implementation


## Overview
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. This README provides step-by-step instructions for implementing PCA.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Ensure that your data is numeric and standardized (mean-centered and scaled to unit variance) since PCA is sensitive to the scale of the variables.

### 2. Compute the Covariance Matrix
Calculate the covariance matrix of the standardized data. The covariance matrix is a square matrix that represents the relationships between all pairs of variables.


### 3. Compute Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
Compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. Eigenvectors represent the directions of maximum variance, and eigenvalues represent the magnitude of the variance in those directions.


### 4. Sort Eigenvalues
Sort the eigenvalues in descending order. The corresponding eigenvectors should be reordered accordingly.

### 5. Choose Principal Components
Select the top \(k\) eigenvectors based on the desired number of principal components (\(k\)) or the variance you want to retain.

### 6. Create Projection Matrix
Form a projection matrix (\(P\)) by stacking the selected eigenvectors as columns.

### 7. Project Data onto Lower-Dimensional Space
Project the original data (\(X\)) onto the lower-dimensional space using the projection matrix
